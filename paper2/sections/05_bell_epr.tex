\section{Bell correlations: scope and constraints}\label{sec:bell}

The X--$\theta$ framework provides a compact geometric language for \emph{non-separable phase structure} on enlarged configuration spaces (e.g., a joint two-particle space $Q_2$). This should not be read as an automatic loophole to Bell's theorem. Any completion that reproduces Bell-violating correlations must explicitly state which Bell assumption is relaxed (typically local causality / parameter independence) and must separately enforce operational no-signalling.

\paragraph{Explicit no-signalling constraint.}
Any proposed model must satisfy
\begin{equation}
P(M_A\mid a,b)=P(M_A\mid a),\qquad P(M_B\mid a,b)=P(M_B\mid b),
\end{equation}
in addition to whatever non-local dependence is introduced at the hidden-variable or joint-connection level.

Details (including a toy generative model and a reference plot of the singlet curve) are moved to Appendix~\ref{app:bell-toy}.
