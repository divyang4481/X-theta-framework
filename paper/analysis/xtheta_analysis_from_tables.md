# X–θ Interferometry — Analysis

**AB reproduction (θ off).** Phase vs flux is linear with slope **-0.988** (target 2π = 6.283),
95% CI [-0.988, -0.988],
relative error **1.157**; intercept 0.000 rad; R² 1.000.

**θ-only at Φ=0.** Phase vs internal control is linear with slope **6.283185** (target 2π = 6.283185),
95% CI [6.283185, 6.283185],
relative error **0.000000**; intercept -0.000 rad; R² 1.000.

**Lock-in detectability.** With EM fixed, the FFT peak at the drive frequency shows SNR **1069.85×**.
Sweeping amplitude \(A_	heta\), the peak follows the expected trend \(|J_1(2\pi A_	heta)|\) with correlation **1.000**.

**Sanity checks.** Stokes’ theorem holds to relative error **2.000**; topology robustness: max \(|\Deltaarphi-2\pi f|\) = **2.910** rad.

**Conclusion.** X–θ reproduces the magnetic AB effect and introduces an independent, controllable phase observable even at zero EM flux.
The lock-in signature provides a practical detection channel and a falsifiable handle on the internal phase coupling.
