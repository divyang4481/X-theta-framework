\section{Motivation and Origin of the Idea}

This work grew out of an attempt to understand the dual nature of quantum
particles more deeply. Inspired by Prof. V. Balakrishnan's NPTEL lectures \cite{BalakrishnanNPTEL} on
quantum physics, we revisit the classic question:

\begin{quote}
Is an electron or photon a particle or a wave?
\end{quote}

Quantum mechanics teaches that it is neither purely a particle nor a wave, but
an entity with both aspects. Our interpretation is that it lies ``in between,''
a hybrid whose description requires a new degree of freedom. This motivates the
X--$\theta$ framework.
