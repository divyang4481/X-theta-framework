\section{Proposed Experiments}

\subsection{Tabletop Double Slit}
Perform double slit experiments under null-EM shielding to look for residual
fringes.

\subsection{Photoelectric Setup}
Shine variable-frequency light on metal surfaces with phase-locked modulation
to test $\theta$ energy channels.

\subsection{Neutron Interferometry}
Adapt existing neutron interferometers to isolate $\theta$-induced phases.

\subsection{Gravitational Wave Observatories}
Search for polarization-dependent delays in gravitational wave signals
(LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA).
