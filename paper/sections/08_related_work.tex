\section{Related Work \& Originality}\label{sec:related-work}
I keep detailed comparisons (e.g., Kaluza--Klein, dark photon) concise here and emphasize what is original: a shared-range $\lambda_\theta$ cross-sector test, $\theta$--AB at null EM, curvature-assisted bounce with WDW barrier, and the compact-fiber vacuum lever.
