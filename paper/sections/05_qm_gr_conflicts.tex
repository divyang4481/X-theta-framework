\section{Points of Tension Between QM and GR}

The X--$\theta$ framework addresses several inconsistencies:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Singularities}: GR predicts infinite curvature, while QM forbids
  infinities.
  \item \textbf{Measurement problem}: QM is probabilistic; GR is deterministic.
  \item \textbf{Wave--particle duality}: Photons and electrons act like waves in
  interference but particles in the photoelectric effect.
  \item \textbf{Gravitational phase}: Ambiguities remain in combining curvature
  with quantum interference.
\end{itemize}
