Imagine our universe has an extra hidden dimension shaped like a circle. In the X--$\theta$ framework, this compact angle $\theta$ is added to ordinary space--time, with the goal of unifying familiar forces like electromagnetism and gravity through a simple geometric idea. I show how this extra dimension influences physical phenomena from electromagnetic fields to quantum mechanics, and I outline clear, testable signatures: phase shifts at zero electromagnetic fields (a $\theta$--Aharonov--Bohm effect), near-harmonic ``rotor'' sidebands with spacing set by the phase inertia, and correlated short-range Yukawa deviations across sectors in a simple Stueckelberg completion. I also connect to cosmology, where the extra degree of freedom behaves as a stiff component and can help regularize singular behavior. Finally, I propose concrete laboratory and astrophysical tests, making the framework not only intriguing but also falsifiable.
